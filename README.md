# BirDePy: Birth-and-death processes in Python

BirDePy is a Python package for working with continuous time birth-and-death processes. It includes functions which can be used to approximate transition probabilities (``birdepy.probability()``), estimate parameter values from data (``birdepy.estimate()``), simulate sample paths (``birdepy.simulate.discrete()`` and ``birdepy.simulate.continuous()``) and generate forecasts (``birdepy.forecast()``). The main focus of the package is the estimation of parameter values from discretely-observed sample paths, however the much more straightforward case of estimation of parameter values from continuously observed sample paths is also included.
