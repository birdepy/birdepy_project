    """Simulation of continuous-time birth-and-death processes at discrete

    Parameters
    ----------
    param : array_like
        The parameters governing the evolution of the birth-and-death
        process to be simulated.
        Array of real elements of size (m,), where ‘m’ is the number of
        parameters.
        These must be in the order given :ref:`here
        <Birth-and-death Processes>`).

    model : string
        Model specifying birth and death rates of process (see :ref:`here
        <Birth-and-death Processes>`). Should be one of:

            - 'Verhulst'
            - 'Ricker'
            - 'Hassell'
            - 'MS-S'
            - 'pure-birth'
            - 'pure-death'
            - 'Poisson'
            - 'linear'
            - 'linear-migration'
            - 'M/M/1'
            - 'M/M/inf'
            - 'loss-system'
            - 'custom'

         If set to 'custom', then kwargs `b_rate` and `d_rate` must also be
         specified. See :ref:`here <Custom Models>` for more information.

    z0: int or callable
        The initial population size for each sample path.
        If it is a callable it should be a function that has no arguments and
        returns an int:

         ``z0() -> int``

    times : array_like
        The times at which the simulated birth-and-death is observed.
        Array of real elements of size (n,), where ‘n’ is the number of
        observation times.

    k : int, optional
        The number of sample paths to be simulated.

    method : string, optional
        Simulation algorithm used to generate samples (see
        :ref:`here<Simulation Algorithms>`). Should be one of:

            - 'exact' (default)
            - 'ea'
            - 'ma'
            - 'gwa'

    tau : scalar, optional
        Time between samples for the approximation methods 'ea', 'ma' and 'gwa'.

    survival : bool, optional
        If set to True, then the simulated sample paths are conditioned to
        have a positive population size at the final observation time.  Since This
        can greatly increase computation time.

    seed : int, Generator, optional
        If *seed* is not specified the random numbers are generated according
        to *np.random.default_rng()*. If *seed* is an *int*, random numbers are
        generated according to *np.random.default_rng(seed)*. If seed is a
        *Generator*, then that object is used. See
        :ref:`here <Reproducibility>` for more information.

    display : bool, optional
        If set to True, then a progress indicator is printed as the simulation
        is performed.

    Return
    -------
    out : array_like
        If k=1 a list containing sampled population size observations at
        `times`, generated according to `model`.
        Or if k>1, a numpy.ndarray containing k sample paths, each
        contained in a row of the array.

    Examples
    --------
    Simulating a unit rate Poisson process with observations at times
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: ::

        import birdepy as bd
        bd.simulate.discrete(1, 'Poisson', 0, times=[0, 1, 3, 4, 5])
        [0, 1, 3, 5, 5]

        `b_rate` and `d_rate`.
        Or if n>= 1, a list of lists where each list corresponds to the jump
        times from one sample path.

    pop_sizes : list
        If k=1 a list containing population sizes at the corresponding jump
        times, generated according to `model`.
        Or if k>1, a list of lists where each list corresponds to the
        population sizes corresponding to jump times from one sample path.

    Examples
    --------
    Simulating a unit rate Poisson process up to a t_max of 5: ::

        import birdepy as bd
        jump_times, pop_sizes = bd.simulate.continuous(1,'Poisson', 0, t_max=5)
        print(jump_times)
        print(pop_sizes)

    Outputs: ::

        [0, 0.0664050052043501, 0.48462937097695785, 2.2065719224651157]
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
